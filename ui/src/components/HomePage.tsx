        SEACoreNLP is an initiative by AI Singapore's NLP Hub that aims to
        provide a one-stop solution for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in
        Southeast Asia (SEA). We hope to lead the way in spearheading projects
        and gathering like-minded entities across the region to build a livelier
        NLP ecosystem for SEA.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        As the name suggests, SEACoreNLP focuses on "core" NLP tasks, such as
        part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing or semantic role labeling, as
        opposed to higher-level tasks such as machine translation or question
        answering.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        This demo hosts various models for core NLP tasks in the official
        languages of ASEAN. Some models were trained by us, and some were taken
        from external libraries. As this is still a work in progress, not all
        tasks or languages are supported yet. You may check out the available
        models through the navigation panel on the left.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        These models are also (mostly) available in our <code>seacorenlp</code>{" "}
        package. Please run <code>pip install seacorenlp</code> to install the
        package. Documentation for the package can be accessed via the{" "}
        <code>Docs</code> link in the top right hand corner of this page.
